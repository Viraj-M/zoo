        <h1>Symptoms</h1>
        <br>
        <h3>Signs of dementia can vary greatly. Examples include problems with:
          <br>

          Short-term memory. <br>
          Keeping track of a purse or wallet. <br>
          Paying bills. <br>
          Planning and preparing meals. <br>
          Remembering appointments. <br>
          Traveling out of the neighborhood. <br>
          Many conditions are progressive, which means that the signs of
          dementia start out slowly and gradually get
          worse. If you or someone you know is experiencing memory difficulties
          or other changes in thinking skills, don't
          ignore them. See a doctor soon to determine the cause. Professional
          evaluation may detect a treatable condition.
          And even if symptoms suggest dementia, early diagnosis allows a person
          to get the maximum benefit from available
          treatments and provides an opportunity to volunteer for clinical
          trials or studies. It also provides time to
          plan for the future.

          <h1>Causes</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>Dementia is caused by damage to brain cells. This damage
            interferes with the ability of brain cells to
            communicate with each other. When brain cells cannot communicate
            normally, thinking, behavior and feelings can
            be affected.

            The brain has many distinct regions, each of which is responsible
            for different functions (for example, memory,
            judgment and movement). When cells in a particular region are
            damaged, that region cannot carry out its
            functions normally.

            Take our free e-learning course
            Understanding Alzheimer's and Dementia outlines the difference
            between Alzheimer's and dementia, symptoms,
            stages, risk factors and more.

            Different types of dementia are associated with particular types of
            brain cell damage in particular regions of
            the brain. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, high levels of
            certain proteins inside and outside brain cells
            make it hard for brain cells to stay healthy and to communicate with
            each other. The brain region called the
            hippocampus is the center of learning and memory in the brain, and
            the brain cells in this region are often the
            first to be damaged. That's why memory loss is often one of the
            earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's.
            While most changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent
            and worsen over time, thinking and memory
            problems caused by the following conditions may improve when the
            condition is treated or addressed: <br>

            Depression. <br>
            Medication side effects. <br>
            Excess use of alcohol. <br>
            Thyroid problems. <br>
            Vitamin deficiencies.</h3>

          <h1>Treatment and care</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>Treatment of dementia depends on its cause. In the case of most
            progressive dementias, including Alzheimer's
            disease, there is no cure, but one treatment — aducanumab (Aduhelm™)
            — is the first therapy to demonstrate that
            removing amyloid, one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, from
            the brain is reasonably likely to reduce
            cognitive and functional decline in people living with early
            Alzheimer’s. Others can temporarily slow the
            worsening of dementia symptoms and improve quality of life for those
            living with Alzheimer's and their
            caregivers. The same medications used to treat Alzheimer's are among
            the drugs sometimes prescribed to help with
            symptoms of other types of dementias. Non-drug therapies can also
            alleviate some symptoms of dementia.

            Ultimately, the path to effective new treatments for dementia is
            through increased research funding and
            increased participation in clinical studies. Right now, volunteers
            are urgently needed to participate in
            clinical studies and trials about Alzheimer's and other dementias.

          <h1>Risk and Prevention</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>Some risk factors for dementia, such as age and genetics, cannot
            be changed. But researchers continue to
            explore the impact of other risk factors on brain health and
            prevention of dementia.

            Research reported at the 2019 Alzheimer’s Association International
            Conference® suggests that adopting multiple
            healthy lifestyle choices, including healthy diet, not smoking,
            regular exercise and cognitive stimulation, may
            decrease the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.</h3>
